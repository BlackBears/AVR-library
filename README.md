AVR-library is a library of conveniences for AVR micro controllers, chiefly peripheral interfaces.  You will need to import various components of Pascal Stang's [AVRLib](http://www.procyonengineering.com/embedded/avr/avrlib/) into your project.  These are all pointed out in the documentation.

In many cases, these are very quick-and-dirty implementations intended to work only with a single target AVR.  As time permits I will generalize them as needed.
